A Chrome extension to auto-loop over URLs for simple testing or traffic gen

Public domain

This extension provides a quick way to simulate page loads - leveraging the real
browser to also load all images, JS, CSS, etc., making it more realistic than, say,
curl or ab.

NB: need to disable cache to ensure pages are really fetched every time

================
Install
================
1. Copy to PC
    ex. /opt/chrome-auto-loop
    # sudo cp -r chrome-auto-loop /opt/

    in /opt/ you need to set owner to system user
    # sudo chown -Rf user:user /opt/chrome-auto-loop

2. Install on Chrome
    Open Chrome to chrome://chrome/extensions/ and install.

    Starts auto-looping through urls.txt right away.
    Press changing color icon to stop/start.
    Modify urls.txt with your urls.

================
Configuration Options
================
* Filetype - take input either from JSON or from TXT input file
* URL prefix - if values from the input TXT need to be tacked on some URL, example: Alexa file info for all sites from TXT, or Google queries that mention URLs from TXT
* Query prefix - string between the URL prefix and values from input TXT, e.g. Google query "site:facebook.com%20"
* Max sleep, ms - default upper bound on random sleeps between pages, unless input JSON provides

================
Limitations/Todo
================
* JS timers are not reliable, therefore request generation timing is not very precise
* doesn't handle POSTs (yet)
* doesn't do multiple tabs/concurrent requests (yet)
* doesn't interact with the actual page very much - could use a content script
* auto-dsable cache
* does not yet re-load the input files, even if the filetype was changed in options
